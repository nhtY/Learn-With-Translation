# Learn with Translation App
A team project developed for Mobile Programming course we took at AGU.

## Description of the App: 
The app is used for improving vocabulary knowledge. It provides the translation of words or phrases. 
The users enter what words they want to learn or memorize and the app will show their translations. 
The word and its translation are kept in card form. The user will be able to create sets of these cards. 
The main learning activity is to take multiple-choice quizzes from the sets. 
To encourage the user, there is a daily goal. The user is able to determine the goal. 

## The Screens the App has:
There are seven screens. These are:

**1. Starting page:** It provides two options, create an account and log in.

**2. Create an account:** It asks the user to determine username, password and to enter an e-mail address.

**3. Log in:** The user will log in by entering username and password information.

**4. User home page:** Username and the progress of daily goal will be shown. There are options which are ‘change the daily goal’, ‘create a new set’ and ‘study’.

**5. Create Set:** The user can determine the title of the set and prepare word cards.

**6. Study:** There is a list of sets. The user can choose one of them to study.

**7. Quiz:** There is a multiple-choice quiz from the chosen set.
